R codes for analysing evolution of vertical space use in a commercial aviary with provision of ramps. Main response variable is bird density and fixed factors are Age*location. 
The data comes from the RGE3 (exp in commercial aviary, Barn 1.1). Age from DOA 8 to 16. Locations: Middle tier Upper tier.
Additionally, to understand how the the different paths that the birds can use for vertical locomotion, we counted the number of birds on long ramps and short ramps from DOA 8 to 16. The long ramp was divided into two halves.
